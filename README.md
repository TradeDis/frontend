### Starting the development server
`expo start`

When you run `expo start` (or `yarn start`), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

> üëã You can close the Expo Dev Tools window and disable it from starting in the future by pressing shift+d in your terminal running Expo CLI. Start it again at any time by pressing d in the terminal running Expo CLI.

### Opening the app on your phone/tablet

> You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously. Go ahead and try it on an iPhone and Android phone at the same time if you have both handy.

- üçé On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
- ü§ñ On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo client app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
